# sneaky.css

A custom sass lib for building css components.

## In Development

This lib is not ready for real world use. For now you can run the lib locally. You need to use `gulp`. install it globally using `npm i -g gulp` or whatever command you wish. Then in the project root run `gulp`. This will compile the sass into css.

If you wish to edit the compiling options edit the `gulpfile.js`
