# sneaky.css

A custom sass lib for building css components.

## Installing

Installing sneaky.css is simple. Locate the [releases](https://github.com/ThatGuyJamal/sneaky.css/releases) tab and download the latest release. This will give you the full compiled sass lib in one index.css file. Simple ref it in your project and your good to go.

If you have any problems please make an [issue](https://github.com/ThatGuyJamal/sneaky.css/issues)

## Self building

This lib is not ready for real world use. For now you can run the lib locally. You need to use `gulp`. install it globally using `npm i -g gulp` or whatever command you wish. Then in the project root run `gulp`. This will compile the sass into css.

If you wish to edit the compiling options edit the `gulpfile.js`

```log
$ gulp
[01:23:46] Using gulpfile ~\project_dir\path\path2\sneaky.css\gulpfile.js
[01:23:46] Starting 'default'...
[01:23:46] Starting 'buildStyles'...
[01:23:47] Finished 'buildStyles' after 693 ms
[01:23:47] Starting 'watchTask'...
```
If everything runs well you should see this output. For more questions please contact me on discord [@ThatGuyJamal](https://discords.com/bio/p/thatguyjamal)
