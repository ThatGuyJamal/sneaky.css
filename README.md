# sneaky.css

A custom sass lib for building css components.

## Self building

This lib is not ready for real world use. For now you can run the lib locally. You need to use `gulp`. install it globally using `npm i -g gulp` or whatever command you wish. Then in the project root run `gulp`. This will compile the sass into css.

If you wish to edit the compiling options edit the `gulpfile.js`

```log
$ gulp
[01:23:46] Using gulpfile ~\project_dir\path\path2\sneaky.css\gulpfile.js
[01:23:46] Starting 'default'...
[01:23:46] Starting 'buildStyles'...
[01:23:47] Finished 'buildStyles' after 693 ms
[01:23:47] Starting 'watchTask'...
```
If everything runs well you should see this output. For more questions please contact me on discord [@ThatGuyJamal](https://discords.com/bio/p/thatguyjamal)
